Hello,

it is Rhyacotriton!

It uses qooxdoo, so download qooxdoo framework to the `qooxdoo` directory.

It stores cached data in `cached`.

The `build` directory is used by cascadae application.

Run in the console to create the release:

```
./generate.py build
```

`qooxdoo` will downdoad `smartTable` application at the first run. It can be very slow.

First compilation takes 6 minutes.
